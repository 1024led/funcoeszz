$ zzdicjargon drum
drum: n.
Ancient techspeak term referring to slow, cylindrical magnetic media that were once state-of-the-art storage devices. Under some versions of BSD
Unix the disk partition used for swapping is still called /dev/drum; this has led to considerable humor and not a
few straight-faced but utterly bogus ‘explanations’ getting foisted on newbies. See also “ The Story of Mel'” in Appendix A.

$ zzdicjargon fork
fork
In the open-source community, a fork is what occurs when two (or more) versions of a software package's source code
are being developed in parallel which once shared a common code base, and these multiple versions of the source code
have irreconcilable differences between them. This should not be confused with a development branch, which may later be folded back
into the original source code base. Nor should it be confused with what happens when a new distribution of Linux
or some other distribution is created, because that largely assembles pieces than can and will be used in other distributions
without conflict.
Forking is uncommon; in fact, it is so uncommon that individual instances loom large in hacker folklore. Notable in this
class were the Emacs/XEmacs fork, the GCC/EGCS fork (later healed by a merger) and the forks among the FreeBSD, NetBSD,
and OpenBSD operating systems.

$ zzdicjargon zap
zap
1. n. Spiciness.
2. vt. To make food spicy.
3. vt. To make someone ‘suffer’ by making his food spicy. (Most hackers love spicy food. Hot-and-sour soup is considered
wimpy unless it makes you wipe your nose for the rest of the meal.) See zapped.
4. vt. To modify, usually to correct; esp. used when the action is performed with a debugger or binary patching
tool. Also implies surgical precision. “Zap the debug level to 6 and run it again.” In the IBM mainframe world,
binary patches are applied to programs or to the OS with a program called ‘superzap’, whose file name is ‘IMASPZAP’
(possibly contrived from I M A SuPerZAP).
5. vt. To erase or reset.
6. To fry a chip with static electricity. “Uh oh — I think that lightning strike may have zapped the
disk controller.”

$ zzdicjargon foobar
foobar: n.
[very common] Another widely used metasyntactic variable; see foo for etymology. Probably originally propagated through DECsystem manuals by Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC) in 1960s and early 1970s; confirmed sightings there go back to 1972. Hackers do not generally use this
to mean FUBAR in either the slang or jargon sense. See also Fred Foobar. In RFC1639, “FOOBAR” was made an
abbreviation for “FTP Operation Over Big Address Records”, but this was an obvious backronym. It has been plausibly suggested that
“foobar” spread among early computer engineers partly because of FUBAR and partly because “foo bar” parses in electronics techspeak as
an inverted foo signal; if a digital signal is active low (so a negative or zero-voltage condition represents a "1")
then a horizontal bar is commonly placed over the signal label.
